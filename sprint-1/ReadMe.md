# Biggest concepts for Learning React.js
- Components
All modern front end framework relies on the component architecture. Component architecture enables the developer to break down the large application into smaller components, which can be further break down into even smaller component. Breaking down the application into smaller component simplifies the application and make it more understandable and manageable.
- JSX
A JavaScript extension to create arbitrary HTML elements using syntax similar to html
React will convert JSX into javaScript object consisting of React's createElement() function
- One way Data binding
prevents the data in a component to flow backward, it can only pass data to its child and cannot be passed by a component to its parent in any situation
Results in simplifying data handling and reducing the complexity

- Scalable
React can be used to create any size application.

- Flexible
React only provides only few basic concepts to create truly scalable applications. React does not restrict the developer in any way to follow a rigis process
- Modular
React componenets can be created in a seperate Javascript file and can be made exportable. 

# advantage & disadvantages

main advantages
- Performance
- Easy to learn
- Huge collection of third party components
- Large community
- SEO Friendliness
- Easy kick-starting of the React project
- Rich set of developer tools
- Handle large application

Disadvantages of react
- Lack of quality documentation
- No standard / recommended way to develop application
- Fast development pace
- Advanced use of JavaScript
- JavaScript extension
- Just a UI library

# ReactJS - Architecture
- React elements
JavaScript representation of HTML DOM. React provides an API, React.createElement to create React Element.

- JSX
A JavaScript extension to design user interface. JSX is an XML based, extensible language supporting HTML syntax with little modification. JSX can be compiled to React Elements and used to create user interface.
- React component
React component is the primary building block of the React application. It uses React elements and JSX to design its user interface. React component is basically a JavaScript class (extends the React.component class) or pure JavaScript function. React component has properties, state management, life cycle and event handler. React component can be able to do simple as well as advanced logic.

# Creating a react Application
### using CDN
#what is react? Why use it?
### javascript library that builds user interface,
- it is client side JavaScript library
- all about building modern reactive user interface for the website
- shrinks all your code to the smallest components possible
- declaritive, component focused approach code

### Building Singe-Page-Applications(SPAs)
- react can be used to control parts of HTML page or entire pages
- react can also be used to control the entire frontend of  a web app
- widget approach on a multipage-aplication

### React Alternatives
- angular (complete component based UI, has more built in feature, can be over kill for smaller project)
- vue.js it is like a mixture of angular and react, it includes more core features, a bit less popular than React & angular



# overview
{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
