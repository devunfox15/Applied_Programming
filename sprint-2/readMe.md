# Overview
As a frontend software engineer, one of the main scripting languages of our day for website is Javascript, Before this research I had an intermidate understanding of the language but have increased my proficency through the study via [W3 schools Javascript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) Here I demonstared the activities and processes of learning. 


The software that I wrote this week was a number guesser in javascript, It gets a random number form 1-100 and has you try to guess it if you succeed you get an output of correct, other wise it tells you wheter it was higher or lower. The reasoning for this is because Javascript loves to pull from html user inputs so i had to learn how to take thoses inputs from there. The biggest thing that I learned was that I needed to find the simple solution first then progress from the harder topics.
